            <p1 style="color: #b9b8cf;">
                Hugs from my heart. And hugs again. Again and again. For some long minutes.. 
            </p1><br>
            <p1 style="color: #b9b8cf;"><b>Neha, Nothing was that complicated as defining how special You are, and how greatful I am
                to be with you.</b> Dont take it as some fabricated sweet words, but truth.
                It's been an year from when I met the most beautiful woman I ever happened to see.
                The one with a highly captivating smile. The one with all those charm. A good cityzen, a 
                greate student, a genuine friend... For me the one I whish to be with on every seconds of my life, 
                the one, to her warmth I wish to hide behind, when things are getting rough.. The one who changed my life into a far better one.. 
                The angel I met.. 
                <br>When I start wiriting the webpage, I was damn sure, I'll be stuck here, when I actually began to write to you.
                When I began to define my feelings, with the limitted number of words in the human language. Cause, I dont know, 
                how can they be enough to describe you, your love, your smile ,.. Neeh, those words are old, you weren't been there when those words are made.. 
                <!-- It's the confusion, I never resolved yet, and I'm admaired by, .. your  -->

                <br>The point, that my words hardly point to, but I was trying to wrote down was.. that,.
                Neeh I Love you. And you means a lot to me. I mean A LOT lot. I can't prove you how much, but 
                you, your presence, your smile, and You Neeh, you means a lot to me. Yes, I'm greatful you re mine.
                (No! the last sentance is not a restriction, I mean I will be greatful to been with you, 
                even if we brake up someday (though, I hate that nightmare)). 
                <br> Good days are coming dear. You got to meet a lot of good people, and to do a great deal of Neeh's magic there.
                They gonna love you. You will be so much happier in that world. They will be happy to see your smile everyday. 
                Wishing the best for my infinite beauty.
